# NodePhishing

This is a super simple Phishing Website written in Node.js.<br />
This is for educational purposes only. I do NOT encourage people to do something illegal.

### How to make it
1. Fist of all, you copy the login page source of the website you want to mimic. (For me, I choose Facebook. No reason at all.)
2. Next, you make a program. (For me, I choose Node.js because it's really simple.)
3. Finally, you publish the phishing website with an appropriate domain name.

### For people who want to use my program 
If you want to mimic another website's login page, you have to copy the page source to index.html and edit server.js for sure.
